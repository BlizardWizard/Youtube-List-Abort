# Youtube-List-Abort
Automatically redirects to non-playlist versions of videos in playlists. Runs with Tampermonkey (or equivalent)


Honestly, I can't be bothered to figure out how GreasyFork works, so just copy-paste the contents of the YoutubeListAbort.txt file into a new Tampermonkey script if you want to use it.
